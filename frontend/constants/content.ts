    id: 'embarrassed',
    title: 'Do you feel embarrassed or awkward about the content you post?',
    explanation: "It's completely normal to feel vulnerable when sharing your work. Remember, every successful creator started exactly where you are now. That awkward feeling? It's not weakness - it's courage in action. You're brave for putting yourself out there.\n\nEvery piece of content you create is a step forward. The discomfort you feel is temporary, but the growth and connections you'll make are lasting. Your unique voice matters, and the world needs to hear it."
  },
  {
    id: 'reactions',
    title: 'Are you scared of how people close to you might react?',
    explanation: "Fear of judgment from friends and family is one of the biggest hurdles creators face. But here's the truth: those who truly care about you want to see you succeed and express yourself.\n\nYour content is YOUR journey. You don't need permission to pursue your passion. The people who matter will support you, and those who don't probably aren't meant to be on this journey with you. You're building something meaningful - stay focused on that."
  },
  {
    id: 'hate',
    title: 'Did you just receive hate comments?',
    explanation: "Hate comments hurt - there's no way around it. But here's what you need to know: haters are often people dealing with their own insecurities. Their negativity says nothing about your worth or your content's value.\n\nEvery successful creator has faced hate. It's almost a rite of passage. Don't let someone else's negativity dim your light. Focus on the people you're helping and inspiring. They far outnumber the haters."
  },
  {
    id: 'views',
    title: 'Are your views not growing?',
    explanation: "Slow growth is frustrating, but it's not a reflection of your content's quality. Growth takes time - often much more time than we expect. Most overnight successes took years to build.\n\nInstead of focusing on numbers, focus on improvement. Each piece of content is practice. Keep learning, keep experimenting, and trust the process. Your breakthrough could be just around the corner. Consistency beats perfection every time."
  },
  {
    id: 'followers',
    title: 'Are your followers not increasing?',
    explanation: "Follower count doesn't define your worth as a creator. What matters is the impact you have on the people who DO follow you. One engaged follower is worth more than a hundred passive ones.\n\nKeep showing up, keep providing value, and keep being authentic. Your tribe will find you. Quality content attracts quality followers - it just takes time. Trust your journey."
  },
  {
    id: 'stuck',
    title: 'Do you feel stuck or unsure how to improve?',
    explanation: "Feeling stuck is a sign that you're ready to level up. It means you've outgrown your current approach and need new strategies. That's growth, not failure.\n\nStudy creators you admire. Try new formats. Ask your audience what they want. Sometimes the breakthrough comes from trying something completely different. Stay curious and keep experimenting."
  },
  {
    id: 'tired',
    title: 'Are you too tired or mentally exhausted?',
    explanation: "Burnout is real, and ignoring it won't help. Your mental health is more important than any content schedule. It's okay to slow down, take breaks, and rest.\n\nQuality over quantity. Your audience would rather wait for your best work than receive rushed content. Take care of yourself first - you can't pour from an empty cup. Rest is productive."
  },
  {
    id: 'lonely',
    title: 'Do you feel lonely on your content creation journey?',
    explanation: "Content creation can feel isolating, especially when you're starting out. But you're not alone - millions of creators feel exactly the same way. The journey might be solitary at times, but the destination is community.\n\nConnect with other creators. Join communities. Share your struggles. You'll find that vulnerability creates the strongest bonds. Your fellow creators understand you better than anyone else."
  },
  {
    id: 'value',
    title: 'Do you feel like you have nothing valuable to offer?',
    explanation: "This is imposter syndrome talking, and it's lying to you. Your perspective, experiences, and voice are unique - and that makes them valuable. You don't need to be an expert to help someone who's one step behind you.\n\nYour story matters. Your insights matter. Your creativity matters. Don't compare your beginning to someone else's middle. Keep sharing, keep creating, and trust that your value will shine through."
