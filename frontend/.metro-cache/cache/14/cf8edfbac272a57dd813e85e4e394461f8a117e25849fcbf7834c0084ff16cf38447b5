Vision Screen - Your Foundation**\nThis is where you define your **ethos** (your core message) and your **content pillars**.\n\n- **Your Ethos**: One sentence that defines what you stand for\n  - Example: \"Studying shouldn't feel miserable\"\n  - Example: \"Creators shouldn't feel alone\"\n  - This is your North Star - it rarely changes\n\n- **Your Content Pillars**: 3-4 main themes you'll consistently create about\n  - 3 pillars based on your interests/skills (these can evolve)\n  - 1 story pillar (this never changes - it's your personal journey)\n  - Each pillar should have multiple content ideas\n\n**2. Audience Screen - Know Who You're Serving**\nUnderstanding your audience is how you create content that actually matters to them.\n\n- **Demographic**: Who are they?\n  - Age range, location, profession, gender breakdown\n\n- **Psychographic**: What do they need?\n  - What struggles do they have?\n  - What do they desire?\n  - What creators do they already follow?\n\n**Pro Tip**: Use the \"Younger You Principle\" - target the version of yourself from 2-3 years ago. You know exactly what they struggled with and desired.\n\n**3. Edge Screen - What Makes You Unique**\nYour uniqueness comes from three places:\n\n- **Pain**: What challenges have you overcome?\n  - This is where your most powerful content comes from\n  - People connect through your humanity, not your highlights\n  - Share your struggles, not just your successes\n\n- **Passion**: What drives you?\n  - What excites you? What makes you feel fulfilled?\n\n- **Experience**: What have you learned?\n  - Qualifications, milestones, who you've helped\n\n- **Skill**: What can you teach?\n  - What you're good at, mastered methods, go-to expertise\n\n**How to Use It Daily:**\n\n1. **Before Creating Content**: Check your Vision screen\n   - Does this idea align with your ethos?\n   - Which pillar does it fit into?\n\n2. **When Stuck**: Review your Audience screen\n   - What problem are you solving for them?\n   - What transformation are you offering?\n\n3. **For Authenticity**: Reference your Edge screen\n   - How does your unique experience relate?\n   - What pain can you share to connect?\n\n**Remember**: Your Creator Universe grows with you. As you evolve, update it. But your ethos and story pillar remain your anchor.`,\n    'how-to-develop-creator-universe': `**How to Develop Creator Universe**\n\nDefine your **ethos**, choose your **pillars**, and build a Universe that grows with you.\n\n**Step 1: Define Your Message (Ethos)**\n\nYour ethos is your core belief - the one sentence you stand for. This is the foundation of your Creator Universe and it rarely changes.\n\n**What is an Ethos?**\n- Your core belief about your topic\n- One powerful sentence that defines you\n- The message that drives everything you create\n- This becomes your \"why\" - your reason for creating\n\n**How to Find Your Ethos:**\nAsk yourself: What do you fundamentally believe about your area of expertise?\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Studying shouldn't feel miserable.\"\n- \"Creators shouldn't feel alone.\"\n- \"Fitness should be accessible to everyone.\"\n- \"Learning can be fun and engaging.\"\n\n**Remember**: Your ethos is your anchor. It's what you always come back to, even as your content evolves.\n\n**Step 2: Choose Your Pillars**\n\nPillars are the main themes you'll consistently create content about. You need two types:\n\n**Interest/Skill Pillars (3 pillars - can evolve)**\n- These are topics you're passionate about or skilled in\n- They can change as you grow and learn\n- Examples: Fitness, Cooking, Travel, Business, Art\n- Choose 3 that excite you right now\n\n**Story Pillar (1 pillar - never changes)**\n- This is your personal story or journey\n- It's always relevant because it's uniquely yours\n- Examples: \"My journey from zero to 100K followers\"\n- \"How I overcame [your challenge]\"\n- \"My path to [your achievement]\"\n\n**Why Your Story Pillar Matters:**\nYour story is what makes you relatable. People connect with your journey, struggles, and growth. This pillar never gets old because it's authentically you.\n\n**Step 3: Accept Evolution**\n\nYour Creator Universe is designed to grow with you, not hold you back.\n\n**The Truth About Evolution:**\n- Your interests WILL change - and that's okay\n- Your skill pillars can evolve as you learn new things\n- This isn't a mistake - it's the system working as intended\n- Your Universe grows as **you grow**\n\n**How to Evolve Gracefully:**\n- When you lose interest in a pillar, replace it\n- When you discover new passions, add them\n- Keep your ethos and story pillar consistent\n- Let your content reflect who you are NOW\n\n**Remember**: The goal isn't to stay the same forever. The goal is to build a Universe that adapts with you while staying true to your core message.`,\n    'treat-account-as-yourself': `**Treat Your Account as Yourself**\n\nYour social media account is your personal brand - how the world perceives you. It should be an authentic extension of who you are, not a separate persona.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\n**Personal Brand = Your Greatest Asset**\n- It allows you to attract opportunities (networking, brand deals, business)\n- You don't have to chase them - they come to your inbox\n- You become a magnet that people gravitate toward\n- This is how entrepreneurship and creative work is headed - all personal branding\n\n**The Reality:**\nEveryone wants to be a creator. Everyone has thought about it. But if you actually act on this desire and succeed, it might make others feel bad about not starting. Remember: you'll never be judged by someone doing more than you - only by those doing less.\n\n**How to Be Authentic:**\n\n1. **Share Your Real Story**\n   - Your actual struggles and pain points\n   - Your genuine wins and transformations\n   - Your authentic voice and personality\n   - Don't just flex - connect through struggle\n\n2. **Don't Create a Character**\n   - You don't need to be \"on\" all the time\n   - Show your real personality, quirks included\n   - Be a peer, not just an expert\n   - Journey POV > Expert POV (you're a few steps ahead, not miles ahead)\n\n3. **Focus on Your Pain, Passion, and Pursuit**\n   - **Pain**: What you've struggled with and overcome\n   - **Passion**: What drives and excites you\n   - **Pursuit**: What you're currently working toward\n   - This makes you the niche - people are attracted to YOU\n\n4. **Show Behind the Scenes**\n   - Real moments, not just highlights\n   - Your process of getting good at something\n   - Document while you're learning\n   - Your journey, not just your destination\n\n**The Mindset Shift:**\n\nInstead of: \"I can't escape 200 view jail\"\nThink: \"200 is a stadium full of fans\"\n\nInstead of: \"I'm not special enough\"\nThink: \"Shared struggles build the strongest connection\"\n\nInstead of: \"I don't have expertise\"\nThink: \"Document while you're learning\"\n\n**Remember**: People follow people, not personas. Your face should show up in your content. This is personal branding - be loud, proud, and bold about building something that aligns with you.`,\n    'why-niching-down-not-good': `**Why Niching Down Is Not Good**\n\nTraditional niching is dead. Here's why focusing on one topic limits your long-term success.\n\n**The Three Core Problems:**\n\n**1. You're Multi-Interested**\n- If you pour into one topic alone, you'll be known for that one topic\n- When you post outside that topic, your content doesn't get the same engagement\n- This makes you feel stuck creating content that doesn't align with you\n\n**2. You Will Evolve as a Human**\n- If you're a student now, you won't be in several years\n- If you're pursuing a specific business, you likely won't be in several years\n- If you're single now, you may not be in several years\n- You want your audience to match your journey, not hold you back\n\n**3. You'll Get Bored**\n- As a creator, the process is intimate - you go from inspiration to execution\n- If you're posting the exact same content, you'll grow tiresome\n- If you don't get bored, your audience will\n- Content fatigue is real from the viewer's perspective\n\n**The Better Approach: Become the Niche**\n\nInstead of niching down into one topic, build your personal brand:\n\n**Personal Brand = How the world perceives you**\n- Your public reputation\n- Your value system, beliefs, and opinions\n- The ability to present exactly who you are and what you offer\n\n**Why Personal Brand Wins:**\n- People champion you as a person, not just your content\n- You build a loyal audience that wants you to win\n- You attract opportunities (business, networking, brand deals)\n- You can experiment with various interests\n- You become the niche itself\n\n**The Solution: Find Your Ethos**\n\nYour ethos is the message that connects your various interests.\n\n**Example Ethos**: \"More people should find financial freedom so they can spend time doing things they love\"\n\nThis connects different pillars:\n- Pillar 1: Financial tips\n- Pillar 2: Business tips  \n- Pillar 3: Relationship advice\n- Pillar 4: Your story (how financial freedom transformed you)\n\n**The Fourth Pillar: Your Story**\n\nYour story pillar never changes. It's how your ethos has transformed you:\n- How has pursuing this life impacted you?\n- What pain did you experience?\n- How did you overcome it?\n- This is where your most powerful content comes from\n\n**Remember**: Say this to yourself: \"I am the niche.\" Your content pillars can evolve, but your ethos and story keep everything connected.`,\n    'what-types-of-content': `**What Types of Content to Post**\n\nDiversify your content to keep your audience engaged and attract new viewers.\n\n**Content Types:**\n\n1. **Educational Content**\n   - Teach something you know\n   - Share tips and tricks\n   - Break down complex topics\n   - Answer common questions\n\n2. **Inspirational Content**\n   - Share your journey\n   - Tell success stories\n   - Motivate your audience\n   - Show what's possible\n\n3. **Entertaining Content**\n   - Make people laugh\n   - Share funny moments\n   - Create engaging stories\n   - Show your personality\n\n4. **Behind-the-Scenes**\n   - Show your process\n   - Share your workspace\n   - Document your journey\n   - Build connection\n\n5. **Problem-Solving**\n   - Address pain points\n   - Provide solutions\n   - Help your audience\n   - Build trust\n\n6. **Personal Stories**\n   - Share experiences\n   - Be vulnerable\n   - Create relatability\n   - Build connection\n\n**The Mix:**\n- 40% Educational\n- 30% Inspirational/Entertaining\n- 20% Behind-the-Scenes\n- 10% Personal Stories\n\n**Remember**: Variety keeps your content fresh and your audience engaged!`\n  };\n  function WhatToPostDetailScreen() {\n    _s();\n    var router =
